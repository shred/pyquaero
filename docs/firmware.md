# Firmware

!!! important
    After a firmware update, some features may not be supported by _pyquaero_ any more (see the table below). If you require a feature, make sure it is still available after the firmware has been updated, _before_ performing the update.

    It is **not** possible to downgrade to an older firmware version again, so do not update if everything is working fine for you.

## Supported Firmware Versions

These are the Aquaero firmware versions currently supported by _pyquaero_:

<span class="fw-yes">Yes</span>: Feature is (almost) fully supported. Some rarely used parts may be missing, though.<br>
<span class="fw-part">Partial</span>: Feature is essentially supported, but some important parts are still missing. <br>
<span class="fw-no">No</span>: Feature is not supported at all.

## Other Firmware Versions

Your firmware version is not listed above?

If the structure version still matches, other firmware versions may be supported as well, but are then untested. If you can spare some minutes, please [file an issue](https://codeberg.org/shred/pyquaero/issues) so we can add your firmware version to the list.

If the structure version is unknown, _pyquaero_ refuses to connect to the Aquaero device. More or less extensive changes to the source code are then needed to make this firmware version work.

If you was able to add support for another firmware or structure version, please send in a pull request!

## Latest Firmware

[Aqua Computer GmbH & Co. KG](https://www.aquacomputer.de) has kindly donated an Aquaero LT for development purposes to this project. It allows me to reverse engineer the latest Aquaero firmware, and eventually support it in _pyquaero_.

Although this is good news, there are some caveats:

* It may take a while until the latest firmware is supported by _pyquaero_. If you rely on a working _pyquaero_, do not update the firmware of your Aquaero until it is supported.
* There is no guarantee that a firmware version will be supported by _pyquaero_. It still bases on reverse engineering, which may turn out to be impossible.
* Even though Aqua Computer donated an Aquaero device to this project, it does not mean that they officially support or endorse it. You are still using _pyquaero_ at your own risk!
