## USE THIS SOFTWARE AT YOUR OWN RISK!

The _pyquaero_ main developer is running this software for several years now, without any negative side effects. However, it is a highly experimental software, and it is based on reverse engineering only.

* This software might damage your Aquaero device in a way that it must be repaired or replaced.
* The use of this software could lead to failure of cooling fans or aqua pumps, which might cause permanent damage to heat sensitive components of your system.
* Using this software might void your warranty.

Neither the _pyquaero_ developers nor the manufacturer can be held liable for any damage caused by this software.

It is strongly recommended to use only the official software!
