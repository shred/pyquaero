reacting on the commands sent by this tool.

WARNING:
 - Your Aquaero device may crash or behave erratic. Fans and pumps might
   stop at any time. Do not use this tool while your Aquaero device is
   in use (e.g. actually cooling a computer).
 - After use, it is recommended to restart your Aquaero device by
   disconnecting it from power for a few seconds.
 - Use it at your own risk.

If you really know what you are doing, set the --i-mean-it option.''')
